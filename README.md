# Home-Assistant-Config
My personal Home Assistant config

I currently run HASSIO 0.63.3 on a raspberry Pi 3 with a 32gb microsdcard.
I have a TP-Link Switch connected to a IKEA discoball in my bedroom.
I have a single Hue Light Bulb in my bedroom.
I also have another server running things such as my personal website, a git server, as well as my automated media system. Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, SABnzbd.

My design is based on a mixture of mf-social and CCOSTAN HomeAssistant Configs
